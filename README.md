Some of the website is really janky so be carefull, whould recommend exploring the Bahrain Grand Prix or Dutch Grand Prix as they look the best in my opinion.

Currently only some of the tracks have track outlines, and some of the track data have not been updates since they have driven more races. Currenlty not possible to select the driver you want to analysie it is automaticlly picked as the winner of the race. Also website is very slow currently and optimizations are planned for furture work.

Currently only 2021 data is available.

If website is not working hosting a localhost server is required for the visuazlisation to work.

This can be done on windows in command prompt with http-server pacakge downloaded or any other way you prefer.
